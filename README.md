# GreenBar

Hi and welcome to goldshire inn :D 

No for real, you can just compile the code and run it. 
I've just added in a read key at the end of the iteration so you can see the actual output of the code after 30 days have been calculated

Changed the logic and splitted of those god ugly if else structure that was set in place and added some smaller methods that handle certain actions.
I have created some unit tests mainly to check wether or not my logic is correct. 
As you might recall (Bubble + HS ftw) I don't have much experience with unit testing so bear with me, this is what I have learned in about 20 min.
You can check the unit tests by running the test explorer selecting the GreenBarTest.cs and pressing the run button

Took me about 2h give or take to come to this result
